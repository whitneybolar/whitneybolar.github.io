      <h4> 
        Our team intended to create an app for use on the Apple Watch that can monitor the user’s HRV (Heart Rate Variability) with these requirements from our client:
      </h4>
      <p> 
      ● Evaluate incoming HRV data for signs of stress
      </p>
      <p>
      ● Alert the user when possible Moderate or High-stress levels are detected
      </p>
      ● Query user as to the accuracy of alerts
      </p>
      <p>
      ● Record user input to further clarify alerts
      </p>
      <p> 
          In this case, we used HRV to indicate to our users the possibility of a runaway TSR/CSR so they can try to de-escalate before they reach the point of no return.
      </p>
      
      <br>

      <h4>
      Functional Requirements:
      </h4>
      <p>
      1. Initialize threshold HRV values by calculating the min, max, average, and standard deviation from stored HealthKit data.
      </p>
      <p>
      2. Read and calculate HRV at a fixed sample rate (will be determined later based on the capabilities/limitations of the device).
      </p>
      <p>
      3. Gather HRV information in the background continuously while the watch is worn.
      </p>
      <p>
      4. Notify the user upon reaching the undesired HRV threshold using both sound and haptic feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
      5. Integrate live calculated data with Apple HealthKit for data storage and export.
      </p>

      <br> 

      <h4>
        Non-Functional Requirements:
        </h4>
        <p>
        ● User Interface: show the descriptive text of the current HRV status.
        </p>
        <p>
        ● User Interface: show live calculated data value of the HRV.
        </p>
        <p>
        ● User Interface: show a graphical view of the HRV trend from a set time (will be determined later based on the capabilities/limitations of the device).

            HRV Calculation Discovery: 
          </h4>
      <p> 
        HRV (Heart Rate Variability) is a measurement of the variable time between heartbeats, but not the rate of heartbeats itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Studies have shown that this metric can be used to indicate when your sympathetic nervous system increases activity due to an impending fight or flight response.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> We are using a formula called Root Mean Squared Sum of the Differences (RMSSD) to calculate HRV, chosen for short-term monitoring. </p>
      <p>
         Utilizing time-domain method to monitor HRV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our time window is 30 seconds which is a recommended short-term monitoring interval.
        Store the time difference in milliseconds of the interbeat time interval (IBI) of each beat/ heart rate value.

        The application can be used to determine an impending fight or flight response. The collected data is isolated on the device itself and encrypted to maintain privacy and security. With user permission, the collected data can be uploaded to the User’s Apple’s Healthkit application
        This data can then be accessed by their healthcare providers as needed with permission.                    
    </p>
<p>
    The HRV machine learning model can predict the current stress level to determine whether a user should be notified.
</p>
<br>

<h4> Classifications: </h4>
<p> low, moderate, high </p>
<p> Notifications will be sent when ‘high’ stress is predicted. </p>

<h4>
    Features we recommend adding for future students:
</h4>
<h6> Functional Requirements </h6>
<p> ● Emergency contact (not for emergency medical aid) setting in the initial setup of the app for situations like panic attacks.</p>
<h6> Non-Functional Requirements </h6>
<p> ● User Interface: show short settings menu for toggling “Contact Emergency Contact when HRV is in danger threshold” and future features.</p>
