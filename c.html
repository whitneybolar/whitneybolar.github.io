        <h4> 
            Interviewees: 
        </h4>
    <p> 
        As a team, we all found different kinds of people on Eastern Washington University campus to create an accustomed difficulty level. We narrowed the users down to 3 types of students:
<p>
    ●  New Undergraduate Students 
</p>
<p>
    ●  Accustomed Undergraduate Students
</p>
<p>
    ●  Graduate Student Employees
</p>
<br>
<h4>
    Graduate Students’ Results:
</h4>
<p>
    I got to interview three graduate student employees. I talked to a program assistant that needed to know most functions for the development of a new website on Wordpress. I talked to the Program Assistant that created the webpage for Pence Union Building at EWU. I also talked to an administrative specialist; she only needed to know a few functions to develop surveys for other students. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Here are their results: 
</p>
<p>
    ● They all struggled in the beginning of their job.
</p>
<p>

    ● All of them agreed that they did not have any recollection of Wordpress as an undergrad. 
</p>
<p>
    ● Most of them thought that if they knew about Wordpress before they graduated with their bachelors, they could have made exceptional work quicker.
</p>
<p>
    ● They did say that Wordpress is an easy program to use, so the learning process was quick and easy to understand. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>
    Conclusion:
</h4>
<p>
    ●  A larger number of staff members use WordPress, because they have access to the EWU webpage.
</p>
<p>
    ●  An average undergrad or graduate student would not have a need to use Wordpress unless their major required it. 
</p>
<p>
    
●  I realized that they have a diverse amount of Wordpress experience influenced by their job description.

        <h4> 
            Persona Intent:  
        </h4>
    <p> 
        The user persona helps influence the revised instructions made for Wordpress users on the EWU website. 
    </p>

<p>
    The persona represents a graduate student that recently got a Bachelors of Arts in Communication and applied for the Graduate Service Appointments (GSA) to get an assistantship position at an advisory office. 
</p>
<p>
    I realized that the Wordpress program has an audience of faculty, staff and students at Eastern Washington University. In response to my discovery, I created a persona that will have the perspective of an EWU staff member and student.  
</p>
<p>
    The persona is based on a GSA staff member in order to help revise instructions for Wordpress. The persona would not need to know all the functions equally to know how to achieve his job. The approach from Carol’s persona is to prioritize the commonly used instructions to help the majority of Wordpress users.

        ●  Our technical writer group created a knowledge base style guide for consistency and professionalism within the wide range of guides requested from Eastern Washington University Information technology. 
    </p>
<p>
●  Created a process of tasks, steps and actions to organize the complexity of technological solutions with a clear process.

        <h4> 
            User Background: 
        </h4>
    <p> 
        The users commonly had a background of little knowledge of WordPress, but the expectancy of graduation neared to the present. The personas made for the instructions influenced the level of experience that the testers held. The instructions consist of fundamental based direction to help beginners like new graduate students or staff members have an understanding of how WordPress works.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4> 
        Results: 
    </h4>
<p>
    ●  Testers used the instructions without any explanation or purpose of the outcome.
</p>
<p>
    ●  The testers understood the graphics without the callback indication.  
</p>
<br>
    <h4> 
        Conclusion:  
    </h4>
    <p> ●  For accessibility purposes we plan to incorporate callback instances when more than one action exists in one graphic, but we are glad to know that the markup we had made sense to the testers. 
    </p>
    <p> ●  As a group, we realized that the instructions needed an explanation in the beginning to satisfy the user's curiosity.
    </p>
    <p> ●  Along with the introduction, we wrote a description of how to use the instructions and we wrote a conclusive indication of what the instructions should have done. </p>
    <p> ●  With a quick explanation the user could give better feedback by knowing the relevance of the instructions to the product. </p>
    <p> ●  I learned that the instructions we made had a positive outcome from our testers. They explained that the graphics and wording were straightforward. </p>
